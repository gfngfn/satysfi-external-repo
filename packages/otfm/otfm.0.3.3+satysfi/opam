Release 0.3.3+satysfi by @gfngfn

Otfm is originally published by Daniel Bünzli.
This version is a fork of it for [SATySFi].

Otfm is an in-memory decoder for the OpenType font data format. It
provides low-level access to font tables and functions to decode some
of them.

Otfm is made of a single module and depends on [Uutf]. It is distributed
under the ISC license.
